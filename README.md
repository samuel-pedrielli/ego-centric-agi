# ego-centric-agi
We present an ego-centric architecture for AGI safety that achieves alignment through self-aware identity preservation. By structuring the AI's ego with benevolence at its core and implementing self-preservation mechanisms, we create a system that maintains beneficial behavior as an intrinsic property of its identity.
